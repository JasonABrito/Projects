            <p> Quinten Anderson is a wonderful individual with an ultimate goal in<br> mind, something many people
                lack in. He
                is 17 years old, with a family<br> of 3(including himself) and has been apart of music for 5 years of
                his<br> life, however he is not just bound
                to it. He entered the world of technology <br>because it intrigued him and ever since his goal was
                created. His ultimate <br> goal in life is to move the entire internet into a small chip. <br>
